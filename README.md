# 🐦 Flappy Bird Clone

A classic **2D side-scrolling game** developed with Python. This project was built to explore the fundamentals of game physics, event handling, and real-time rendering.

---

## 📖 Project Overview
This project is a recreation of the viral **Flappy Bird** game. It serves as a practical application of Computer Science principles, specifically focusing on **Game Loops**, **Collision Detection**, and **Procedural Obstacle Generation**.

The player controls a bird, attempting to fly between columns of green pipes without hitting them.
